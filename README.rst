Embeding python output in LaTeX
===============================
This project provides style python.sty and octave.sty that enable to run python/octave code from within LaTeX and mebed its output in the document.

**Note**: By default LaTeX and its variants disallowing calling of arbitrary shell commands. python.sty requires unrestricted
to the shell in order to execute embedded Python scripts. When running python.sty you must execute ``latex`` or ``pdftex`` with
either the ``-enable-write18`` or ``-shell-escape`` command line argument to enabled access to the Python executable.

example.tex
    Example usage of python.sty.

pytex.vim
